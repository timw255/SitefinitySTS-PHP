SitefinitySTS
=============

PHP STS for Sitefinity

You can use this as a base for building your own token services for Telerik Sitefinity CMS. Configured much the same way as shown on: http://docs.sitefinity.com/administration-set-up-sso-with-windows-authentication

Keep in mind, this is an example/port from the SitefinityStsWebApp. For a deeper level of integration with another system, custom membership/role providers ~~may~~ will probably be necessary.

Enjoy!
